# Satoyama
Our web platform aims to spread the satoyama culture worldwide, promoting sustainability and the connection with nature through urban gardening. We encourage individuals to cultivate their own gardens in small, urban spaces. Through this platform, our goal is to create a virtual community that provides valuable information about urban gardening and promotes sustainable practices.
